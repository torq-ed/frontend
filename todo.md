Here's a **prioritized implementation order** for the ideas, balancing feasibility, user value, and dependencies:  

---

### **Phase 1: Core MVP (Launch Essentials)**  
*Focus on foundational features to launch a functional app.*  
- [x] 1. **Topic-Wise PYQs** (categorized by chapter/year).  
- [ ] 2. **Basic Test Generator** (manual selection of chapters/years).  
- [ ] 3. **Bookmarking with Custom Tags** (e.g., "Gand Phaad Question").  
- [x] 4. **Basic User Profiles** (username, progress tracking).  
- [ ] 5. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**.  
- [x] 6. **Question Search Functionality**.  
- [ ] 7. **Formula Sheets/Quick Revision Notes**.  
- [ ] 8. **Mock Test UI Replica** (NTA-like interface for realism).  
- [ ] 9. **Community Solutions** (with basic moderation).  
- [ ] 10. **Installable App** (PWA for desktop/mobile).  

---

### **Phase 2: Engagement & Retention**  
*Add features to keep users active and motivated.*  
- [ ] 1. **Streak System** (daily goals and reminders).  
- [ ] 2. **Gamification** (XP, ranks, achievements like "NO DOUBTER").  
- [ ] 3. **Public Profiles** (time per chapter, accuracy stats).  
- [ ] 4. **Third-Party Login** (Google, Reddit).  
- [ ] 5. **Flashcards System** (learn, match, test modes).  
- [ ] 6. **Spaced Repetition Reminders** (algorithm-based revisions).  
- [ ] 7. **"Padhle BSDK" Notifications**.  
- [ ] 8. **Basic Analytics** (questions solved, accuracy trends).  

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**  
*Complex but high-value additions to differentiate the app.*  
- [ ] 1. **Customizable "Baddie" Notifications** (anime waifu animations).  
- [ ] 2. **AI Chatbot for Doubt Solving** (basic Q&A with Gemini/OpenAI).  
- [ ] 3. **Dynamic Syllabus Tracking** (automated progress per chapter).  
- [ ] 4. **PDF-to-CBT Conversion** (OCR for uploaded papers).  
- [ ] 5. **24/7 Live Quizzes** (real-time leaderboards).  
- [ ] 6. **Competition DPP Integration** (auto-generate from coaching materials).  

---

### **Phase 4: Scalability & Sustainability**  
*Infrastructure and long-term viability.*  
- [ ] 1. **Hosting Optimization** (scaling for large user bases).  
- [ ] 2. **Advanced Moderation Tools** (for community content).  
- [ ] 3. **Legal Compliance** (copyright checks for PYQs/content).  
- [ ] 4. **Open-Source Licensing** (student-only modification rights).  

---

### **Phase 5: Experimental/High-Risk**  
*High-effort, high-reward moonshots.*  
- [ ] 1. **AI-Driven Priority Prediction** (financial modeling).  
- [ ] 2. **Handwritten OCR for Solutions** (edge detection).  
- [ ] 3. **AI-Generated Study Paths** (custom routines).  
- [ ] 4. **Real-Time Group Study Features** (collaborative solving).

### **Rationale**  
1. **MVP First**: Start with core features like PYQs, test generation, and bookmarks to validate the app's utility.  
2. **Engagement Next**: Gamification and streaks keep users returning, creating a habit loop.  
3. **Technical Debt Later**: Infrastructure and legal work are critical but can follow initial traction.  
4. **Save AI/ML for Later**: These require significant resources and should wait until the user base is stable.  

This order ensures a functional product reaches users quickly while building momentum with incremental improvements.
